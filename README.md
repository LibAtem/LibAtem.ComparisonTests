# LibAtem.ComparisonTests

This is a test suite for LibAtem to check it behaves the same as the official SDK, and with multiple versions of the protocol

It requires .Net4.5 on Windows due to using the official [Blackmagic ATEM SDK](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/atem-live-production-switchers)

Note: this is not yet complete for any version.

### Device support
These tests are written primarily for 8.0+, and the intention is to keep them updated with new releases of the sdk to ensure there are no regressions in the LibAtem library.

### Usage
Coming soon
