# LibAtem.ComparisonTests

This is a test suite for LibAtem to check it behaves the same as the official SDK

It requires .Net4.5 on Windows due to using the official [Blackmagic ATEM SDK](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/atem-live-production-switchers)

Note: this is not yet complete, but existing functionality is stable and unlikely to undergo massive changes.

### Device support
This is known to work well with ATEM firmware 7.2, and is likely to work with others.

### Download
